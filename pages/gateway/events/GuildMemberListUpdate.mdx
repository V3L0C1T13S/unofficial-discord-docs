# GUILD_MEMBER_LIST_UPDATE event
Sent when the Gateway wants to perform a member list operation on the client. Each of these
"ops" correspond to an operation the client will perform with its local member list.

NOTE: This documentation is heavily based around the implementation by Reflectcord, which
maintains a full list, and converts it to equivalent OPs for the client.

## OP types

### SYNC
Sent when the server wants the client to resynchronize a range of OPs. This directly replaces
items in the member list with those sent by the server.

### UPDATE
Sent to update an item at a certain index.

NOTE: This requires you to send an entire item, not a partial.

### INSERT
Insert an item at an index. Note that this does not overwrite an already existing item. If
you need to replace an item, use UPDATE instead.

### DELETE
Remove an item at an index via splicing. It's important to note that due to this being a splice
on the client, it will mutate the indexes of every item. If you need to remove an item without
mutating the index, use INVALIDATE instead.

### INVALIDATE
Delete a range of items in the list. This uses a plain old delete, which does not mutate
the indexes of every item.
