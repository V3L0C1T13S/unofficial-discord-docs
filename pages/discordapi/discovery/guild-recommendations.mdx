## How it works

**This content is SPECULATION**

### Recommendation algorithim

Discords guild recommendation algorithim figures out how to recommend you servers
based on many different factors.

Behiavor suggests that your game activity is the biggest factor in what servers you
should be recommended. Many users have reported that after playing games for an
extended period of time with their game activity turned on, they will be recommended
servers for that game.

Another big factor is the servers you're currently in. You're much more likely to see
gaming servers if you're active in gaming servers most of the time.
